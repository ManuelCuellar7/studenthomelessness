<p class="text"> There's been a 42% increase in student homelessness since the start of the decade. Each year, approximately 30,000 students in New York spend time living in shelters. At least 3,860 were unsheltered, living in cars, parks, or abandoned buildings.</p> 

<p>While the total number of students reported to be living in
temporary housing was 9% lower last year than in 2019–20, the pandemic likely impeded schools’ ability to identify students
experiencing homelessness. Many students learned remotely
for the entirety of the 2020–21 school year, making it less
likely that school staff would become aware of changes to
their housing situations. In addition, overall school
enrollment also fell last year, by 3.3%, and grade-by-grade,
declines in homelessness followed trends in overall
enrollment; in both cases, the most significant drops
occurred in pre-K and kindergarten.</p>
