      <p> Every night, the DHS (Department of Homeless Services) registers approximately 15,000 school-age children, ages 4 to 17, sleeping in shelters in New York City.</p>

 <p>Among homelesss students, Hispanic/Latinx and their families tend to have even more obstacles. Randi Levine, policy director at Advocates for Children of New York, emphasized how the barriers to participating in children's education are magnified for families experiencing homelessness whose primary language is a langauge other than English. "The city should ensure that these families receive school-related documents and information in their primary langauge and have access to translation and intepretation".</p>

    <p>New York City public and charter schools identified nearly 115,000 homeless students during the 2019-2020 school year. The reason this number is so much higher than that found in city hostels is because untold numbers of young people experience nights in "shared" (or "double-up") places with friends or other associates. For example, they sleep on a sofa in an apartment where their name does not appear on the lease or on occasions, exchanging sex for a place to sleep, according to city records. 58% of the students living in “shared” places are Hispanic / Latinxs.</p>
